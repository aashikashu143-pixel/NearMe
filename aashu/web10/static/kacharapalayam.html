        The Gomukhi Dam is a significant man-made reservoir located at the foothills of the scenic Kalvarayan Hills near Kallakurichi, Tamil Nadu. Completed in 1965, the dam and its accompanying reservoir are a vital water source, primarily serving irrigation needs for over 10,000 acres of agricultural land and more than 40 villages in the district.
